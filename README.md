## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ci1xgk/Seamless-web/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ci1xgk/Seamless-web/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### 1. About 
SEAMLESS is a new two-dimensional (2D) model aimed to facilitate flood simulation over a range of scales for the mesh and domain-sizes in both deterministic and scholastic settings. SEAMLESS is currently under development by taking a mathematics-led approach to come with a coherent framework, under the themes of “automatism” and “holistisity”, in handling flood modelling applications. 

### 2. Contact and acknowledgments: 
The development of SEAMLESS is currently led by [Georges Kesserwani](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/civil/staff/academic/gk) supported by an EPSRC Fellowship Scheme. The science and thinking behind the development of SEAMLESS is owed to following research grants: 

- Jan. 2018 - Apr. 2023, EPSRC Fellowship Scheme, “Smart forecasting: joined-up flood forecasting (FF) infrastructure with uncertainties”, funder ID: “EP/R007349/1”. 

- Mar. 2014 - Jul 2015, EPSRC First Grant Scheme, “Unified flood model with optimal zooming and linking at multiple scales”, funder ID: “EP/K031023/1”. 

- Aug. 2013 - Feb. 2014, DAAD Short-Term Grant, “Transforming flood risk modelling: collaborative research schedule with RWTH Aachen”, funder ID: “A1372005”.
