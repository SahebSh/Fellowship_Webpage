## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ci1xgk/Seamless-web/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ci1xgk/Seamless-web/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### 1. About
SEAMLESS is a new two-dimensional (2D) model aimed to facilitate flood simulation over a range of scales for the mesh and domain-sizes in both deterministic and scholastic settings. SEAMLESS is currently under development by taking a mathematics-led approach to come with a coherent framework, under the themes of “automatism” and “holistisity”, in handling flood modelling applications. 


### 2. Contact and acknowledgments 
The development of SEAMLESS is currently led by [Georges Kesserwani](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/civil/staff/academic/gk) supported by an EPSRC Fellowship Scheme. The science and thinking behind the development of SEAMLESS is owed to following research grants: 

- Jan. 2018 - Apr. 2023, EPSRC Fellowship Scheme, “Smart forecasting: joined-up flood forecasting (FF) infrastructure with uncertainties”, funder ID: “EP/R007349/1”. 

- Mar. 2014 - Jul 2015, EPSRC First Grant Scheme, “Unified flood model with optimal zooming and linking at multiple scales”, funder ID: “EP/K031023/1”. 

- Aug. 2013 - Feb. 2014, DAAD Short-Term Grant, “Transforming flood risk modelling: collaborative research schedule with RWTH Aachen”, funder ID: “A1372005”.


### 3. Rationale
The need to better forecast and model flooding is of strategic importance to society and science. Policy-makers continue to desire more accurate and comprehensive flood warning maps to issue for public protection against flood events. Hydraulic consultancy and software industry firms still aspire to achieve significantly greater intelligence, reliability, coverage and functionality in their next-generation of hydraulic models, which can particularly obviate manual labour for excessive user iterations in building and running flood models, better control scaling effects due to inter-regional dependencies and more efficiently forecast uncertainty propagation. Aligned with these needs, scientists and engineers across many research communities still seek to develop a modelling framework that is “intelligent” and “holistic”, in the sense of being:
- Adaptable (able to embed and self-select a cascade of scales) 
- Reliable and efficient (to ensure a high-quality answer, in as rapid a time as possible)
- Versatile (applicable to solve a wide/compound range of physical scales and/or domains)
- Comprehensive (inform on numerical-model error and/or physical uncertainty propagation)
