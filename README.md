The development of SEAMLESS is currently led by [Georges Kesserwani](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/civil/staff/academic/gk) supported by an EPSRC Fellowship Scheme. The science and thinking behind the development of SEAMLESS is owed to following research grants: 
- Jan. 2018 - Mar. 2023, EPSRC Fellowship Scheme, “Smart forecasting: joined-up flood forecasting (FF) infrastructure with uncertainties”, funder ID: “EP/R007349/1”. 
- Mar. 2014 - Jul 2015, EPSRC First Grant Scheme, “Unified flood model with optimal zooming and linking at multiple scales”, funder ID: “EP/K031023/1”. 
- Aug. 2013 - Feb. 2014, DAAD Short-Term Grant, “Transforming flood risk modelling: collaborative research schedule with RWTH Aachen”, funder ID: “A1372005”.
